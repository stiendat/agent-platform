 * truth) — the rbac-parity test asserts they are identical. After editing
 * either, run `pnpm gen:rbac`.
 *
 * Sensitive fields (promotion readiness, salary band) are gated by their own
 * permission AND stripped at the data-retrieval tool boundary for non-HR
 * audiences — before any value reaches the LLM context. See `audienceFromRoles`
